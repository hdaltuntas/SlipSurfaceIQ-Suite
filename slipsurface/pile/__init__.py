SlipSurface IQ Pile — axial capacity, group action and settlement of piles, and the
length of a rock socket, driven from a browser.

The program works out how much load a pile, or a group of piles, in a layered
soil profile can carry, how long it has to be, and how much it settles:

    1. Stresses        — σv0, u0 and σ'v0 down the shaft, with the water table
    2. Shaft friction  — the α methods (API RP 2A, Kulhawy & Phoon, Sladen),
                         the β method and the λ method in clay; K·σ'v·tan δ in
                         sand, with Meyerhof's critical depth; the SPT rule
    3. Base resistance — Meyerhof, Vesić and Janbu; 9·cu, Vesić's Nc* and
                         Janbu's Nc* in clay
    4. Pile weight     — subtracted from the ultimate capacity, buoyant below
                         the water table
    5. Group action    — the efficiency by Converse–Labarre, Los Angeles,
                         Seiler–Keeney and Feld, and block failure
    6. Required length — the shortest pile that satisfies the single-pile and
                         the group check
    7. Settlement      — a single pile (Vesić), and the group by the
                         equivalent raft (consolidation and elastic), Vesić's
                         √(Bg/D) rule and Meyerhof's SPT rule
    8. Rock socket     — the unit side shear of every published correlation,
                         the base resistance, the socket length each of them
                         needs, and the elastic settlement of the socket
                         (Randolph & Wroth; Vesić)

On top of it, a parametric or reliability study sweeps any input (a range, or
a distribution) and reports sensitivities and the probability of failure.

The interface is a local web server driven from the browser (standard library
only), so the program also runs over a remote session or inside a container,
where a desktop toolkit would need a display it does not have.
